    "On an e-commerce site, it is crucial that products are categorized correctly. Incorrect categorization can lead to products being invisible to buyers and create a poor user experience, especially when large quantities of products are misplaced in the wrong category.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Guidelines:</u>\n",
    "- Analyze the data and describe some possible classification algorithms for such a dataset.\n",
    "- Choose and implement at least one of these algorithms using the training set (data_train.csv) and perform a prediction on the provided test set (data_test.csv). Specify the chosen metrics. Explain your steps.\n",
    "- Conduct a complete analysis of the obtained results.\n",
    "- Do not use the category hierarchy as an explanatory variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Dataset Size:</u> \n",
    "- The dataset contains 241,483 entries, which is reasonable for applying simple models with fewer parameters that should suffice for effective modeling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<u>Features:</u>\n",
    "- All 128 features are numerical and of type float, with no missing values. This reduces the need for complex preprocessing and extensive feature engineering.\n",
    "- High dimensionality due to the 128 features suggests that dimensionality reduction could be beneficial before applying certain algorithms.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Feature Correlation:</u>\n",
    "- The features are uncorrelated, indicating that simple linear models might perform well. However, potential interactions between features should not be dismissed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Product Categories:</u> \n",
    "- There are 101 product categories, which are identical in both the train and test sets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Category Distribution:</u>\n",
    "- The distribution is reasonably similar between the train and test sets, but the problem is highly imbalanced, with up to a 10x difference in category occurrences.\n",
    "- In order to avoid bias towards the majority classes, techniques such like class weighting, undersampling or oversampling like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Evaluation Metric:</u>\n",
    "- Given the significant class imbalance, the F1-score is an appropriate evaluation metric. It balances precision and recall, making it effective in situations where the cost of false positives and false negatives are high, as in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Remarks:</u> \n",
    "- Automatic EDA tools like \"ydata_profiling\" demand significant computational time, particularly for large or high-dimensional datasets like this one."
